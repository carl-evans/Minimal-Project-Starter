# Minimal Project Starter
Lightweight personal project starter that makes development easier with very few packages.

# Download
git clone https://github.com/carl-evans/Minimal-Project-Starter.git

# Purpose
When learning new skills and building small projects to reinforce learning, it can be nice to have a starting point to maintain quality in work; especially when sharing work with others.

# Getting started
Run 'npm install' then 'npm run build'

# BrowserSync
BrowserSync will open a new server that watches the CSS and JS files in the dist folders. By default, it reloads when there is a change to any HTML files. However, you are welcome to customise this in the package.json NPM script 'dev-watch'.

# Sass
The Minimal Project Starter compiles Sass into CSS and outputs it as regular, compressed CSS in the dist/css folder.

# JavaScript
The Minimal Project Starter transpiles next-gen JavaScript to ES5 and minifies it in the dist/js folder.
